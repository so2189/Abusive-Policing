    	<!-- Information about the case + what happened -->

		<p> Jaahnavi Kandula was a bright, energetic 23-year-old student at Northeastern University Washington. She was fatally struck down by a patrol car driven by Kevin Dave, a Seattle Policeman, at a pedestrian crossing over 9 months ago.

		Kevin Dave was apparently speeding at 74 mph in an area with a 25 mph speed limit, responding to a drug overdose priority one call when he struck Jaahnavi in the crosswalk. She was taken to the hospital where she died from injuries sustained in the accident.

		The body camera recording has Auderer laughing and suggesting that Kandula’s life had <strike style='color: red'> <span style='color:black'> “limited value”</span></strike> and the city should “just write a check – eleven thousand dollars. She was 26 anyway.” (Source: CNN) </p>

		
		<p> A rally to honor the life of Jaahnavi Kandula started in the heart of the Chinatown International District ended with a broader goal and call for police accountability within the Seattle Police Department (SPD).

		Dozens gathered for Jaahnavi Kandula and marched to the Seattle Police Officers Guild headquarters after body camera video of its Vice President Daniel Auderer making insensitive comments about Kandula after her death in January recently came to light. However, the case is still under investigation and Auderer has not faced any consequences or accountability, despite his clear lack of empathy for human lives. </p>
