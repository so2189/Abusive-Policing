			<h1 style="font-size: 80px; color: darkred;">Abusive Policing</h1>

			<div class="bold-text">
				<p>Abusive policing refers to the use of excessive force, misconduct, or discriminatory practices by law enforcement officers during their interactions with individuals or communities. This issue has been a topic of concern and debate in many countries, including the United States. Abusive policing takes various forms.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Excessive Use of Force</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>This is one of the most common forms of abusive policing. It occurs when officers use more force than necessary to subdue a suspect or maintain control of a situation. This can result in serious injuries or even death.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Racial Profiling</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>Racial profiling involves law enforcement officers targeting individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or perceived background rather than on evidence of criminal behavior. This discriminatory practice can lead to unjust arrests and harassment of minority groups.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Police Brutality</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>Police brutality encompasses various forms of physical or verbal abuse by law enforcement officers. It can include beatings, use of tasers or pepper spray without justification, and other forms of aggression.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Unlawful Arrests and Detentions</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>Abusive policing can also involve the unlawful arrest or detention of individuals without proper cause or due process, violating their civil rights. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Misconduct and Corruption</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>This includes dishonest or unethical behavior by police officers, such as planting evidence, falsifying reports, or engaging in bribery. Such actions undermine trust in law enforcement and the justice system.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Lack of Accountability</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>One of the significant concerns related to abusive policing is the perceived lack of accountability for officers who engage in misconduct. This can be due to factors like qualified immunity, which shields officers from personal liability in many cases.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-title">
				<p>Community Policing and Trust</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>Abusive policing erodes trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Building positive relationships through community policing can help improve trust and cooperation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="bold-text">
			<p>Public awareness, activism, and the use of body cameras and civilian oversight committees have become essential components of addressing this complex issue. In Jaahnavi's case, the reported body camera footage and its publicization has brought attention to her case that will hopefully result in the suspension of her offender.</p> </div>
